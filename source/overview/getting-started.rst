Getting Started
========================

To setup a profile, you "register" by using :ref:`.profile create`. This will create a profile and other user-specific data and fill the profile with initial information.

.. note::
	Registration is only required to setup your own :ref:`profile <Profiles>` and to explore the :ref:`Deepsea Metro <Mini-games>`. Features such as the utility and fun commands are fully available at any time, regardless of whether you have a profile or not.

You can then set the individual profile fields using their respective :ref:`.profile` subcommands. A list of these commands is available at anytime by using :ref:`.help module profile`.

Most notably are :ref:`.profile ign <command profile ign>`, :ref:`.profile fc`, and :ref:`.profile rank <command profile rank>`.


Getting information
--------------------------------
Firstly, you're already on the right track for getting info; this documentation is one of multiple resources available to you.

Telephone bot has several built-in commands providing similar information, from :ref:`general help topics <overview>` (including excerpts from this web documentation), to :ref:`listings of available commands <commands>`, and detailed command usage information; all available without leaving Discord.

.. sidebar::
	Duplicate information: ``.help`` vs. ``docs.telephone-bot.net``

	Telephone bot's :doc:`help command </commands/help>` and this web documentation are primarily duplicates of one another. In fact, some of these very pages were originally copied directly from using the help command itself!

Here's a quick overview of the help commands:
	
-	For a list of modules, use ``.help modules``.
-	For more information about a particular module, use the ``.help module`` command.
-	For detailed help regarding a specific command, use the ``.help command`` command.
-	To view the latest news about Telephone, use the ``.news`` command.
-	For live support, you can use the ``.discord`` command to quickly join the support server.


Understanding usage examples
--------------------------------
Each command's listing gives an example of its usage in a long standing convention to indicate what different arguments are, and which are required or option:

-	**<required>** information is placed between a pair of greater-than/less-than signs or guillemets.
-	**[optional]** information is placed between brackets.

.. important::
	You don't actually type brackets or inequalities when specifying what you want to a command. They only exist in the usage examples so you know what is needed, and what else you can optionally do.
